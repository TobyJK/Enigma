# Enigma
Making an enigma machine in Python, written while I was at school

## Files
originalEnigma.py is the original, basic one made first, where you enter the settings and type a letter which is encoded. actualEnigma.py was my optimised version of that and written in a much nicer way, but runs in the same way. graphicalEnigma.py takes the functionality from the first two but used tkinter to create a GUI so the enigma operated in a much more realistic way.
